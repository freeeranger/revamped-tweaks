### Coding style for commits (no feature commits, only bugfixes):
* Tabs over spaces.
* Document your code with comments, but don't over-comment.
* Follow standard java guidelines (PascalCase for classes, camelCase for variables, { on the same line etc.)

### Usage without Minecraft: Revamped
* Not recommended since it will require a LOT of tweaking to make it useful, but it is possible if you really want to. 
* I will not provide any documentation for it, but feel free to contact me if you need any help or more information
